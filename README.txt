# AnimeFLlist
Current Version: 2018.4 Anime
Next Version: 2018.4 Anime
This file contains the reasons why cards are added or removed from the list

IMPORTANT:
Due to how alias works in Ygopro, anime cards that have an OCG counterpart have to be banned/limited via OCG ID. This leads to many problems, but, unfortunately, it's what we have for now.
