Duel Mode cards like Boss Duel should not be banned, they shouldn't be considered the same thing as anime cards.
Since Edo is preparing duel modes for them, let them be handled that way and remove them as cards you can add to deck edit maybe.

Not every Timelord should be in the same place.
Some, like the one that does half LP damage, should maybe be banned.
Others are almost identical to their IRL counterpart and should be unlimited (or even considered for removal?).
The anime 513 ones are also weaker because you need a specific trap to summon them without Tribute, and should be considered for lighter restrictions.

Timelords:
Sandaion TF6 - Free 4k beater (admittedly does no battle damage) that does 2k burn when it attacks. 4 turns of this shaving off your LP seems pretty potent, could see a limit or other hit.
Halion TF6 - Burns your LP until its as low as yours. Requires you to be losing, can be safely unlimited IMO.
Raphion TF6  - Volcasaurus, can be safely unlimited.
Gabrion TF6 - Shuffles 1 target into deck. Worse than OCG Kamion, safely unlimit.
Kamion TF6 - Almost identical to OCG, safely unlimit.
Zaphion TF6 - Ditto
Michion TF6 - Half opponent's LP. Kind of a potent effect to get for free, could see a limit or something.
Lazion TF6 - Similar to OCG, would say safely unlimit. Only worry is it's kinda Trickstar Lycoris but ehh
Sadion TF6 - Almost identical to OCG, safely unlimit

Sandaion Anime - 4k burn and deals damage with 4k body, a direct attack is a one hit kill, and while you can't normal summon anime timelords you can special summon them by any method. Probably ban?
Zaphion Anime - Floats into Anime Card of Demise. Ban.
Metaion Anime - Similar to OCG besides summoning con, probably safe to unlimit.
Kamion Anime - Spins whole board and burns, probably worth a hit though not sure what level exactly.
Lazion Anime - Also spins whole board but with no burn, maybe hit but not as much as kamion.
Halion Anime - Works if you're winning, but it still feels kind of niche and unreliable, not sure it needs to be hit.
Gabrion Anime - Spins entire board, including backrow this time. See Lazion?
Sadion Anime - See Metaion
Michion Anime - See TF6
Raphion Anime - See TF6
