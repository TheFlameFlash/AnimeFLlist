Illegal cards (Match Winners, ZeXal "Shout this phrase", etc.) should not automatically be limited. The Zexal ones, except the banned ones, don't do much, let alone with one of them banned, and should be unlimited.
The match winners too are basically vanillas and IMO should unlimited.
Not every Timelord should be in the same place.
Some, like the one that does half LP damage, should maybe be banned.
Others are almost identical to their IRL counterpart and should be unlimited (or even considered for removal?).
The anime 513 ones are also weaker because you need a specific trap to summon them without Tribute, and should be considered for lighter restrictions. 
Duel Mode cards like Boss Duel should not be banned, they shouldn't be considered the same thing as anime cards.
Since edo is preparing duel modes for them, let them be handled that way and remove them as cards you can add to deck edit maybe.
Numbers Exist is basically Synchro Gift and should be unlimited
Dark Wall of Wind, a worse Waboku, should be unlimited.

alright i saw skimming that we've already discussed pitfall and the main two ppals, but:
Mistrust/Traitor Fog (if in-game still)
Free, one-sided Vanity’s x Snatch Steal

Performapal Springoose (Anime)
Non-OPT self-bounce

Photon Satellite (Anime)
Infinite level increase, easy FTK with Dark Strike Fighter

Altar of Restoration
Recur any card from grave, the cost doesn’t make it any less broken than Burning Soul.




{odd-eyes persona dragon anime} -> watchlist Bastion outdated, Monster Effect is no longer Quick unless evident later
{performapal lizardraw anime} -> watch list
{number evaille} -> watch list (highly): potential easy EX milling and easy 1 card summon specific Number Monster
Negative Energy, Negative Energy Generator, Pump Up! -> watch list, easy ATK booster by huge amount
Dark Magic Curtain Anime-> any Spellcaster in hand or Deck, potential abusal, but benefit opponent that uses Spellcaster as well
Fusion Future-> Ban

Proposal: Odd-Eyes Phantasma Dragon Limited instead of Banned, debatable however
