1-Illegal cards (Match Winners, ZeXal "Shout this phrase", etc.) should not automatically be limited.
The Zexal ones, except the banned ones, don't do much, let alone with one of them banned, and should be unlimited.

The match winners too are basically vanillas and IMO should unlimited.

Not every Timelord should be in the same place.
Some, like the one that does half LP damage, should maybe be banned.
Others are almost identical to their IRL counterpart and should be unlimited (or even considered for removal?).
The anime 513 ones are also weaker because you need a specific trap to summon them without Tribute, and should be considered for lighter restrictions.

Duel Mode cards like Boss Duel should not be banned, they shouldn't be considered the same thing as anime cards.
Since Edo is preparing duel modes for them, let them be handled that way and remove them as cards you can add to deck edit maybe.
